KUALA LUMPUR (March 5): The recently approved Mass Rapid Transit 3 (MRT3) Circle Line project is set to catalyse socio-economic growth throughout Malaysia, according to Mass Rapid Transit Corp Sdn Bhd (MRT Corp) chief executive officer Datuk Mohd Zarif Hashim. 

In a statement Friday (March 4), Mohd Zarif said this would in turn increase the nation’s competitiveness in the region, as well uplift the well-being of “Keluarga Malaysia”.

Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob via a statement announced that the Cabinet had greenlit the MRT3 Circle Line, almost four years after the project was halted.

MRT Corp said the MRT3 Circle Line will cover some 50km and have a circular alignment running along the perimeter of the city of Kuala Lumpur, comprising elevated and underground sections, and equipped with 31 stations.

“MRT3 Circle Line is a much-needed piece of connectivity of the Klang Valley Integrated Transit Network under the National Transport Policy and a critical component of the future multi-modal mobility under the Keluarga Malaysia Structure Plan 2040.

“It will provide modern, affordable and efficient public transport for Keluarga Malaysia,” it added.

Mohd Zarif said MRT Corp, as the project developer and asset owner of the MRT3 Circle Line Project, will continue to prioritise local contractors — including Bumiputera players — in order to create business and job opportunities. 

“This will be achieved through greater emphasis on local rail system technologies, industrialised building system (IBS) and building information modelling (BIM) solutions, and upgrading of expertise and skill sets through various programmes such as technical and vocational education and training (TVET),” he added.  

MRT Corp also expressed its gratitude to Ismail Sabri and the government for approving the MRT3 Circle Line and thanked them for the trust given to the company to spearhead the project.
